Project: Temperature and Humidity Analysis with Graphs

Overview
This project is a Python script developed in a Jupyter Notebook that reads, processes, and visualizes temperature and humidity data recorded from measurement boards.
The data was collected using DHT sensors connected to an ESP32 microcontroller.


The goals are:

Calculate daily averages for the variables of interest.
Generate line charts for visual analysis.
